Q. 1 :- What is React Js? 

ans: 
React.js, commonly referred to as React, is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that manage their own state. React is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

Here are some key features and concepts of React:

1. Component-Based Architecture: React applications are built using components, which are self-contained modules that render a part of the UI. Components can be nested, managed, and handled independently.

2. Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to optimize rendering. When the state of an object changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then calculates the most efficient way to update the actual DOM, minimizing performance bottlenecks.

3. JSX (JavaScript XML): React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows mixing HTML with JavaScript. This makes the code easier to write and understand by providing a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to both JavaScript and HTML developers.

4. One-Way Data Binding: React enforces a unidirectional data flow, which makes it easier to understand and debug an application. Data flows down from parent to child components through props, and components notify changes through callbacks.

5. State Management: React components can maintain their own internal state, which allows them to render dynamic content. State management can be further enhanced using libraries like Redux or Context API for larger applications.

6. Hooks: Introduced in React 16.8, hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` simplify state management and side-effect handling in functional components.

7. Ecosystem and Tooling: React has a rich ecosystem with tools like Create React App for bootstrapping new projects, React Router for routing, and various state management libraries. It integrates well with other libraries and frameworks.

React is widely used for building web applications, mobile applications (using React Native), and even for developing desktop applications with tools like Electron. Its component-based architecture and efficient rendering make it a popular choice among developers for creating scalable and maintainable applications.
